# Hololearn Hub
Welcome! Maybe you're here because of our [article](https://www.educationandlearning.nl/news/holograms-for-learning) or maybe you've heard us talk somewhere about our dream-like project **"HoloLearn"**. HoloLearn (**H**olographic **L**earning) project aims to stimulate richer social interactions in online/distance education between students and teachers by making use of holograms. The project aims to achieve two major goals.
1. Seamless integration of holograms in current [distance] teaching practices (Recording, replay and hosting facilities) 
2. Explore implications of holograms on social interactions and educational outcomes.

HoloLearn takes inspiration from several similar milestone porjects. In 2015, Prof. Hawking famously gave his lecture while being projected as a hologram in London (see figure above) which garnered much attention to the technology. Tecnológico de Monterrey, inline with the previous example, have used holograms as an advanced communication channel that facilitates presence in remote classes (see below).

Building on such works, this project address the following scenarios in distant education.
<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th> </th>
    <th>Lecturer locally present</th>
    <th>Lecturer remotely present</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>All students in one room</th>
    <td></td>
    <td>Holographic recording and streaming</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Students at home</th>
    <td>Individual holographic projectors, Hololens, Tablet, Smartphone etc</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
</table>

The following diagram visualizes (Updates as project progresses) a conceptual setup for the project.
